# System-Analysis-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
* The DriverPass project was to create a system that allows customers to sign-up and login to an online profile for a company that specializes in preparation for driving tests. The client was the DriverPass company who is owned by Liam. The system was designed to run on a cloud provider and allows customers to purchase a driving package based on their needs. The customer needs to book appointments for driving practice and the system needs to provide learning materials. 

**What did you do particularly well?**
* I feel like my diagrams accurately portrayed a feasible DriverPass system. I accounted for the business needs by meeting functional, non-functional and technical requirements. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
* I would improve my UML class diagram. I would add username and password attributes to the User class and would add a DMV class that will check the DMV database for updated info. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
* I made a list of each user need and decomposed each need into requirements. The requirements provide guidance for the design and test of the system and ensures user needs are met. It's important to design with the user's needs in mind or else they will not be happy with the final product. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
* I approach designing software by gathering user needs and determining requirements of the system. From there I create UML diagrams that can describe the systems structure and behavior. Finally the design needs to be analyzed to remove errors. In the future, I will apply System Development Lifecycle techniques to design, implement, and maintain the system.
